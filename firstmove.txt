I sing to help them find themselves. The stage just makes it easier.
Everything sings to me! I've gotta sing it all back.
It can't be as simple as us versus them. I know if I sing loud enough, they'll listen!
Wow. All these songs sound amazing. I'll bring them into harmony!
When I'm on stage, I feel complete. I wanna help everyone find that peace.
Hello, world! I'm Seraphine, and you are beautiful!
Everyone's singing the same song and they don't even know it!
